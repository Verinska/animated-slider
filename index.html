              Bradwarden is the champion of the centaur race, having won his honor by killing every challenger in the arena of Omexe. Awarded the prestigious Great Belt of Omexe for his feat, Bradwarden commands respect, and fellow centaurs
              rally to join in him combat.[1] Like other centaurs, Bradwarden believes combat to be the ultimate art form, likening swings of his blade to singing.[2] He has accumulated at least a hundred victories in the arena, as
              evidenced by his Bloodrage Axe, taken from a vanquished warrior.[3] As part of his duties, Bradwarden protects the Gloried Horn of Druud, a sacred relic that calls all centaurs to battle.[4] When he dies, Bradwarden wishes to
              be buried in the grounds of Omexe.[5]

              Davion is the Dragon Knight, a title that represents both his occupation and his dual nature. A seasoned warrior of the Scaled Knights of Uthorian, Sir Davion is best known for being the one chosen vessel of Slyrak's essence,
              enhancing his knightly skills with a dragon's strength and granting him the powers of an elder dragon.

              Azwraith is fond to delivering long, morally righteous lectures, especially to Mireska.[1] After defeating Vorn, Azwraith is loath to return to Pole, his native village, although he knows he would be welcomed back. This is
              because he knows the village would have no place for his phantom illusions.[2] Azwraith owns a spear tipped with a crystal charged with Vorn's enemies, helping him focus his illusions on a single purpose.[3]

              Alone stands Sylla the Lone Druid amongst the forgotten ruins of his prehistoric Bear Clan. Long ago, the forces of nature sought the most learned in nature's workings and Sylla stepped forth to answer. Given to him alone was
              the charge of protecting the Seed that it may fulfill one purpose: to sow it upon desolate land and sprout new life when the singularity of life bereft has come for the world. Hope for the planet's renewal after its utter
              desolation lies in this man, even when no one's around to root for him as he outlives us all.
