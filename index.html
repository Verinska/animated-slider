              Bradwarden is the champion of the centaur race, having won his honor by killing every challenger in the arena of Omexe. Awarded the prestigious Great Belt of Omexe for his feat, Bradwarden commands respect, and fellow centaurs
              rally to join in him combat.[1] Like other centaurs, Bradwarden believes combat to be the ultimate art form, likening swings of his blade to singing.[2] He has accumulated at least a hundred victories in the arena, as
              evidenced by his Bloodrage Axe, taken from a vanquished warrior.[3] As part of his duties, Bradwarden protects the Gloried Horn of Druud, a sacred relic that calls all centaurs to battle.[4] When he dies, Bradwarden wishes to
              be buried in the grounds of Omexe.[5]

              because he knows the village would have no place for his phantom illusions.[2] Azwraith owns a spear tipped with a crystal charged with Vorn's enemies, helping him focus his illusions on a single purpose.[3]

              desolation lies in this man, even when no one's around to root for him as he outlives us all.

              heirlooms from both. Like other Keen, Kardel inherited a gun from his father, the Killstealer.[9] Until Kardel makes the same perfect shot he did when he killed the Steepstalker, he cannot return to Knollen.[10] Rigwarl hates
              Kardel, for the same reason he hates all Keen; he considers them small and weak.[11] Kardel is particularly fond of Knollen's midsummer carnivals, especially its shooting gallery.[12]
